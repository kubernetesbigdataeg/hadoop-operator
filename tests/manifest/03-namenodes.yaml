      # Use hostNetwork so datanodes connect to namenode without going through an overlay network
      # like weave. Otherwise, namenode fails to see physical IP address of datanodes.
      # Disabling this will break data locality as namenode will see pod virtual IPs and fails to
      # equate them with cluster node physical IPs associated with data nodes.
